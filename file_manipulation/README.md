# Normal File Manipulation

## Email Address Counter

You are given a text file named emails.txt that contains a mix of text and email addresses scattered throughout. Your task is to:

    Read the file line by line.
    Extract all valid email addresses (following the pattern: username@domain.com).
    Count how many times each unique email address appears in the file.
    Print the email addresses along with their counts, sorted in descending order of occurrences.
